Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

Because then users are allowed to access their files from anywhere

it primairly helps keep all the files/information of one user in one place for them to access

kerberos is bascailly a protocol used for authentication that uses tickets to authenticate.

when you want to protect LDAP authentication

it allows two nodes to communicate securely, the client authenitcats to the AS, and forward it to the key distriburtion center. from there it gets issued a ticket and returns the encrypted results to the users workstation.
